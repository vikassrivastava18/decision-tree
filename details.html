                            <p>
                                You are a resident of New Delhi and this is the winter season. Also new year is not far
                                away, when you get a one week holiday. It is time to decide a place for perfect
                                vacation. You sit with your family and everyone starts to give opinions.
                                Someone says, they care about nothing but picturesque place to visit. Another says it is
                                all about good food. Someone is prioritizing the budget.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So you are stuck and no consensus is getting built. Should it be <b>Darjeeling, Shimla,
                                    Jaipur, Kanyakumari or Mathura</b>?
                                Finally, you call an urgent meeting and get involved in a serious discussion with family
                                members. As a convener, your job is give robust arguments and build a consensus fast.
                                Here is how you can go about it:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>It's winter so let's forget going North. So Darjeeling, Shimla cancelled.</li>
                                <li>Budget demands not to travel too far, so Kanyakumari is cancelled.</li>
                                <li>We already visited Mathura two years back and should we not explore something new.
                                    So</li>
                                Mathura is cancelled.
                                <li>Let's plan to travel Jaipur!</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>
                                By carefully considering important criteria's, we can come to a consensus quickly. The
                                Decision Tree is all about picking the right criteria to split the dataset to arrive at
                                some conclusions fast.

                                    <p>As you can see from the diagram above, a decision tree starts with a root node,
                                        which
                                        does not have any incoming branches. The outgoing branches from the root node
                                        then feed
                                        into the internal nodes, also known as decision nodes. Based on the available
                                        features,
                                        both node types conduct evaluations to form homogenous subsets, which are
                                        denoted by
                                        leaf nodes, or terminal nodes. The leaf nodes represent all the possible
                                        outcomes within
                                        the dataset.</p>
